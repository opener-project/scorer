# Scorer

Component that stores results from the Opener Web Services chain into a MySQL 
Database and shows them into your browser.

It can be used instead of Opener Outlet, to calculate overall sentiment score
and sentiment score per topic.


## Installation

### As part of a Gemfile in a Ruby application

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'opener-scorer',
        :git=>"git@github.com:opener-project/scorer.git"

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

The Opener Scorer comes equipped with a simple webservice. To start the
webservice type:

    scorer-server

This will launch a mini webserver with the webservice. It defaults to port 9292,
so you can access it at:

    http://localhost:9292

To launch it on a different port provide the ```-p [port-number]``` option like
this:

    scorer-server -p 1234

It then launches at ```http://localhost:1234```

When you run a chain of web services using callbacks, the last URL should be the
one that points to the Scorer Web Service. A unique id is generated and once the
chain has finished processing the text, you can view the result in the URL that
you get.
